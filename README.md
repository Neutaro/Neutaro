# Why you should care about Neutaro
Neutaro is closely working with Timpi to help them create the first truly decentralized search engine! On Neutaro you can claim your rewards for contributing to Timpi and you can vote on different proposals affecting Timpi. These proposals will for example be about the ethical standpoint of the Timpi search engine.

# Introduction
You can be a part of Neutaro by having tokens and delegating those, running a node or by becoming a validator.

# Delegating
By delegating your tokens to a validator you increase the ammount of staked tokens they have and by that their voting power. In return you get a cut of their rewards based on the ammount you have delegated.

# Running a node
Running a node means that you run the chains binary. This node can be used to run your own Neutaro chain to play around with. But the node can also be connected into the Neutaro network.
To connect the node to our network you have to add a persistent peer in your config.toml and import our genesis.json file.

# Becoming a validator
To become a validator you have to follow the steps above and on top of that you have to send a create-validator transaction. This can be done using the CLI on your node.
