## 💡 Why Neutaro?

Neutaro is the governance and reward chain backing **Timpi** — the first decentralized search engine.  
As a Neutaro participant, you can:

- 🛠 Run a validator or node to support the network
- 💸 Stake tokens and earn rewards
- 🗳 Vote on proposals — including **ethical decisions** that affect the Timpi search engine’s direction

## 🛡️ Security First

Running a validator comes with responsibility.  
Please read the official Neutaro **Security Guide** to help protect your node from common threats:

- Ensure network integrity
- Participate in governance
- Earn staking rewards

## 💡 Delegate Instead of Validating?

Not ready to run a full validator?  
You can **delegate your tokens** to an active validator and still earn rewards:

```shell
Neutaro tx staking delegate <validator_address> 100000000uneutaro --from YOURWALLET --chain-id Neutaro-1
